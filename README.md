Have you ever attended an event only to be dissapointed by the catering team?
This app will resolve the problem by allowing all those who are invented to an event to specify in advance which meal they intend to eat.
This further allows the catering team to save money,since only listed items are accounted for.
We will use firebase authentication and cloud firestore to pass the data in and out the entire application.
